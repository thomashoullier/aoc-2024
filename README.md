# AOC 2024
These are our Advent of Code 2024 solutions, this year in Lua.
We solved everything this year.

## Dependencies
Nothing but pure lua was needed. No third party modules or libraries were
needed.

## Comments
The scripts are not clean at all, I only cared about getting the answers
with the minimal amount of effort.
